# Payment Gateway Project

This project is a payment gateway system built using the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express, React, Node.js) and demonstrates a simple payment gateway integration using Razorpay within a MERN stack application. The primary objective is to test the payment functionality and understand how to implement a payment system using Razorpay's API.
